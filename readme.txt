The most complete Lottie Player yet. Lightweight, easy to use, accepts LottieJSON and dotLottie, and works with Gutenberg, Divi Builder, Elementor and Flatsome UX Builder.

== Description ==

**The most complete Lottie Player yet.**

AM LottiePlayer is easy to use, lightweight, and gives you total control over how to implement crisp, vectorized animations to your website. Easily set up user interactions, choose between JSON or the optimized dotLottie format, choose whether to serve the files from a CDN or your own *Media Library*, choose whether to render the animations as malleable SVGs or performant Canvases, and choose how to scale the animation. You can add a description for screenreaders and search eninge crawlers.

Upload Lottie animations to WordPress and add them to Gutenberg, Divi, Elementor, Flatsome UX Builder, or via the shortcode [am-lottieplayer].

= Features =

- Contains two Gutenberg blocks: a player and a cover block with text overlay – great for headers.
- Contains a Divi Builder Module
- Contains an Elementor Widget
- Contains the shortcode `[am-lottieplayer]`
- The shortcode is compatible with Flatsome UX Builder
- Scripts are only loaded for pages where the player is used
- Upload Lottie JSON or dotLottie files to your *Media Library*
- Drag & drop a Lottie JSON or dotLottie file
- Insert a Lottie JSON or dotLottie animation from URL
- Choose renderer, scaling, speed, size, background color, interactions and more from the block settings in Gutenberg. The same settings are accessible in the Divi Module menu, the Elementor Widget menu and the Flatsome UX Builder menu.
