The most complete Lottie Player yet. Lightweight, easy to use, accepts LottieJSON and dotLottie, and works with Gutenberg and Divi Builder.

== Description ==

**The most complete Lottie Player yet.**

AM LottiePlayer is easy to use, lightweight, and gives you total control over how to implement animations to your website. Choose either JSON of the optimized dotLottie files, choose whether to serve the files from a CDN or your own **Media Library**, choose whether to render the animations as crisp, malleable SVGs or performant Canvases, and choose how to scale the animation.

Upload Lottie animations to WordPress and add them to Gutenberg, Divi or via shortcode [am-lottieplayer src="*" autoplay="true/false" controls="true/false" loop="true/false" objectFit="cover/contain/none"]. Choose between renderers, fill mode and more.

= Features =

– Use the Gutenberg Editor or the Divi Builder to add animations to your website
– Upload Lottie JSON or dotLottie files to your **Media Library**
– Drag & drop a Lottie JSON or dotLottie file
– Insert a Lottie JSON or dotLottie animation from URL
– Choose renderer, scaling, speed, size, background color and more from the block settings in Gutenberg. The same settings are accessible in the Divi Module menu. Alternatively you can use the shortcode [am-lottieplayer src="*" autoplay="true/false" controls="true/false" loop="true/false" objectFit="cover/contain/none"].
