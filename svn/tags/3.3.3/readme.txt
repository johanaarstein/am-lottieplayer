* Because we've launched a [PRO version of this plugin](https://www.aarstein.media/en/am-lottieplayer/pro) some features, like boomerang, animation segments, external selector and the option to choose renderer has been removed from the free tier. Certain methods from animations made with After Effects (like loopOut) has also been omitted. The upside is that this plugin is now even more lightweight and less RAM intensive than before. To anyone who still might experiences this as a downgrade: you're free to continue to use [any version of this plugin below 3.0.0](https://wordpress.org/plugins/am-lottieplayer/advanced/). However, if you'd like to support the development of this plugin, the premium version starts at $2.75 a month ($33 a year), and contains several requested features like the ability to combine and control multiple animations in a single file, or convert and optimize JSON to dotLottie.
