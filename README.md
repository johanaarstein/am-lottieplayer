# LottiePlayer – WordPress plugin

## Vector animations for WordPress

#### Upload Lottie animations to WordPress and add them in Gutenberg. Choose between renderers and fill mode.

LottiePlayer is easy to use, and gives you, the user, total control over how to implement animations to your website. Choose either JSON of the optimized dotLottie files, choose whether to serve the files from a CDN or your own **Media Library**, choose whether to render the animations as crisp, malleable SVGs or performant Canvases, and choose how to scale the animation.

### Features

- Use the Gutenberg Editor to add animations to your website
- Upload Lottie files to your **Media Library**
- Drag & drop a Lottie JSON file
- Insert a Lottie animation from URL
- Choose file type, renderer, scaling, speed, size, background color and more from the block settings in Gutenberg.
